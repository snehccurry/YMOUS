# About Y -MOUS

```
Iam Y mous. Imake videos on youtube and I m interested in hacking! My ex liked hackers so I became one and den I hacked her social medias to know her reality and then wen I get to 
know that she lied to me... I felt a bit bad! I hacked her mom's id bank ids' and this is how it all started! at the end I wanted revenge from sheero! the bitch! 
so I made this tool! I missed her but then now I don't cuz she never loved me and fooled me for two years! she complained that I didn't let her flirt with anyone! 
indeed she was a play girl! 
anyways! cheers to her parents who forgot to use a condom 9 months b4 31st of July!

so use this tool if someone did u wrong!

at the end! all I want you to do is give me a sub on this channel! 
n honestly let's be evil for Good! 
If Karma has blocked you! you become karma! 
but then don't do wrong to people or destroy their life!
